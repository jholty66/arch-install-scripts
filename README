Personal Arch install scripts

The scripts perform a minimal install of Arch Linux for UEFI bios, ZFS file syst
em and System-D boot bootloader.  They do not partion, format or mount disks, 
that is done manually.

To use, clone this repositofy into the the root users home folder of the 
installed system, '/mnt/root/' by default. Read all files and customize the 
installation through 'custom.sh'. './install.sh --all' to install
automaticcaly. or use a mix one of the options listed in  './install --help'.

Note, if using ZFS, make sure to use an ISO that supports the ZFS filesystem.
