*About*

Personal Arch install scripts. Pretty much the commands found at
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Select_the_mirrors,
but with a few additions (such as optional support for ZFS filesystems.)
and customizations options in order to work on different hardware.

*What the scripts do*

Perform a minimal installation of Arch Linux for UEFI bios, ZFS file
system and System-D boot bootloader.  Any extra changed can be made at
the end of the installation. You will be prompted to create a user as
well.

*What the scripts do not do*

They do not automate creating, partioning and mounting filesystems, this
can vary largely depending on the user, it is simpler on both ends to
choose manual partition management.  When modifying =custom.sh=, add
each filesystem's package in the =tools= variable to make all chosen
filesytems supported on first boot.
*How to get the scritps*

*How to get the scripts*

If the iso installer has git, clone the repository at the beginning of
the installation, otherwise clone it onto a USB and then mount it during
installation.

=git clone https://github.com/jholty66/gentoo-insaller=

*How to use the scripts*

Modify =custom.sh=, to suit hardware and customization preferences. Read
all of the scripts (200 lines of code) before installing as they are
only used on my personal computers. cd into the cloned repository. Call:

=sh install.sh=

If the scripts are terminated before chanding root, run =sh
bootstrap.sh= to continue. If the scripts are terminated after changing
root, run =sh chrot.sh= to continue.

Note, if using ZFS, make sure to use an ISO that supports the ZFS
filesystem.
